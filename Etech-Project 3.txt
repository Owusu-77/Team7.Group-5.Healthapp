Jenkins group level project 
Problem1: 
- What is a Jenkins plugins? 
Ans:
A Jenkins plugin is a piece of program code that when installed enables jenkins to 
extend its functionalities beyond its initial configuration. Engr. Owusu
- Name 5 jenkins plugins and their use cases
i. Docker Pipeline- This is a Jenkins plugin which allows building, testing, and using Docker images 
from Jenkins Pipeline projects

ii. Jacoco-plugin (JaCoCo)-A plugin for Jenkins to capture and visualize code coverage testing results for 
projects using the JaCoCo for code-coverage analysis.

iii.Blue Ocean- This plugin offers intuitive CD pipeline visualizations, a 
user-friendly pipeline editor, personalized Jenkins UI, pinpoint issue identification, and seamless 
integration with GitHub and Bitbucket for efficient collaboration.

iv.PIT Mutation- This plugin displays pitmutation report statistics

v..SonarQube Scanner- This plugin allow easy integration of SonarQubeâ„¢, the open source platform for 
continuous Inspection of code quality. 

- What is the differences between scripted pipeline and declarative pipeline? 
Scripted Pipelines begin with "nodes" when declaring the script whereas declarative pipelines begin
with pipeline when opening the "script"
- Use generic syntax to demo scripted and declarative pipeline as code 

scripted pipeline:
node{
	stages{
		stage(1-'clonecode'){
			actions
		}
		stage(2-'artifactbuild'){
			actions
		}
		stage('3-unitest'){
			actions
		}
	}
}


declarative pipeline:
pipeline{
	agent any
	stages{
		stage('1-clonecode'){
			steps{
				sh 'action1'
			}
		}
		stage('2-artifactbuild'){
			steps{
				sh 'action2'
			}
		}
		stage('3-unitest'){
			steps{
				sh 'actions3'
			}
		}
	} 

- What is a stage-level variable and how is it different from top-level variables? 

- What informations does Jenkins need to integrate with github platform? 
- How do inject script into your pipeline? 
- What are the similarities between a dependency and a plugin? 
- How do you configure service account credentials for Jenkins? 

Problem2: 
- Build an N-STAGE Jenkins pipeline where N=number of group members such that each stage should represent members name 
- Use the git flow best practice and add a ReadMe file on your steps to contribute to a project 
- Each member should write a simple two steps of (ps -ef and sudo systemctl status Jenkins)
